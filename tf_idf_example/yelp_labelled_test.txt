No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	1
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
They have a really nice atmosphere.	1
Worst Thai ever.	0
After one bite, I was hooked.	1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	1
Spend your money elsewhere.	0
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	0
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	1
And the drinks are WEAK, people!	0
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1
-My order was not correct.	0
Awesome selection of beer.	1
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
Great food and awesome service!	1
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1
We won't be returning.	0
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	1
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
As for the service, I thought it was good.	1
Very, very sad.	0
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
Overall, I like there food and the service.	1
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	0
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	1
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.	1
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0
Never had anything to complain about here.	1
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1

There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	1
This place is disgusting!	0
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1
The RI style calamari was a joke.	0
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.	1
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	1
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0
This is a GREAT place to eat!	1
Disappointing experience.	0
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.	1
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	0

One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1
We won't be going back.	0
The block was amazing.	1
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
This place lacked style!!	0
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	1
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1
Don't bother coming here.	0
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1

The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
I had a pretty satifying experience.	1
It was equally awful.	0
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	1
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1
very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	1
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	1
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	1
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	1
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	1
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
And service was super friendly.	1
Con: spotty service.	0
This place was such a nice surprise!	1
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0
They were golden-crispy and delicious.	1

Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1
The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	1
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0
I love this place.	1
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0
I can say that the desserts were yummy.	1
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	1
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.	1
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0

We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0

I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".	0
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	1
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	1
The ambiance isn't much better.	0
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
The price is reasonable and the service is great.	1
The food wasn't good.	0
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1

I love their fries and their beans.	1
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.	1
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.	1
Food was below average.	0
The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	1
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
Go To Place for Gyros.	1
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	0
Seriously killer hot chai latte.	1
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	0
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	1
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	1
Spend your money and time some place else.	0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	1
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0

the presentation of the food was awful.	0
The pizza selections are good.	1

I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	0
Overall, a great experience.	1
Appetite instantly gone.	0
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	1
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1
